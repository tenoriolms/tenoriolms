Hi 👋, I'm Lhucas (*yes, that’s not a typo*).
I'm a data scientist, chemical engineer, researcher, and software development enthusiast with a strong background in data analysis and mathematical modeling.

Currently, I work as a research fellow at Embrapa and my projects focus on developing interpretable and scalable solutions for engineering challenges and real-world problems.

I'm relatively new to the field of data engineering, but I already have solid experience with data analysis and programming, built upon a strong academic foundation—especially in engineering and applied research.

If you're interested, feel free to explore my [📁 projects here 📁](./docs/portfolio.md).
