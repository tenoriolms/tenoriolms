In addition to an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA), several machine learning models (**Random Forest**, **SVM**, and **ANN**) were applied to predict the performance of these materials. To enhance predictive accuracy, data engineering techniques were used to impute missing values via a KNN-based approach. Beyond offering a unified and comprehensive dataset, this project enabled the construction of a predictive model with residual errors **50% lower than existing models in the literature**. <br><br> Most importantly, a common factor across different materials was identified, allowing the development of a **generalized model** capable of handling a heterogeneous range of membrane materials. |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> ‚á® [2023 \| Master‚Äôs thesis](https://repositorio.ufu.br/bitstream/123456789/39065/1/aprendizado_de_maquina_aplicado.pdf) <br> ‚á® 2021-2023 \| Codes: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ñ∏ [EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lhucastenorio/ch4-databank-modeling-eda) <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ñ∏ [Values Imputation](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lhucastenorio/ch4-databank-modeling-values-imputation) <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ñ∏ [Random Forests model](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lhucastenorio/ch4-databank-modeling-random-forests) <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ñ∏ [SVR model](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lhucastenorio/ch4-databank-modeling-svm) <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ñ∏ [Artificial Neural Network model](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lhucastenorio/ch4-databank-modeling-neural-network) <br> ‚á® [2024 \| Article publication](https://doi.org/10.55905/oelv22n3-164)  <br>&nbsp;|

The findings reveal that factors such as **sleep duration**, **daily usage time**, **mental health**, and **frequency of online conflicts** are strongly associated with social media addiction, which in turn negatively **impacts academic performance**. Furthermore, **women and younger individuals** appear to be more vulnerable to this dependency. Among the platforms, **Instagram**, **TikTok**, and **WhatsApp** stood out as the most addictive. Interestingly, relationship status showed no significant correlation with social media addiction. |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> ‚á® [2025 \| Exploring Media Addiction in Students with EDO](https://github.com/tenoriolms/dataset_students) <br>&nbsp;|

Both **Random Forest (RF)** and **Neural Network models** were tested, with RF being selected due to its comparable performance and superior efficiency, complemented by an analysis of the training sample fraction for optimization. |&nbsp;<br> ‚á® [2025 \| arXiv Scientific Research PLN Modeling](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lhucastenorio/arxiv-scientific-research-pln-modeling) <br>&nbsp;|

The challenge is to predict whether a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic. | Programming Learning | After performing an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the dataset, advanced **feature engineering** was applied, including the creation of new variables based on family structure and passenger titles. *One notable insight was the correlation between ticket information and survival, possibly linked to cabin location.* To enhance model generalization, highly correlated features were removed through robust feature selection. The **importance of each variable** in predicting survival was also assessed. For modeling, a **Random Forest (RF) classifier** was selected and optimized using **cross-validation** to avoid overfitting. Different feature combinations were tested to achieve the best predictive performance. |&nbsp;<br> ‚á® [2025 \| Titanic Modelling with RF](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lhucastenorio/titanic-modelling-with-rf) <br>&nbsp;|

Its main goal is to serve as a practical reference toolkit throughout the various stages of a machine learning pipeline. While major libraries like *scikit-learn*, *pandas*, and *matplotlib* offer robust general-purpose tools, Kuka fills the gaps by providing streamlined and customized utilities for tasks that are commonly needed but not readily available out-of-the-box. |

The library allows users to define ODE systems through text files or docstrings, solve them using numerical integration, visualize results, and perform parameter optimization against experimental data. It also includes common error metrics for model evaluation. |
