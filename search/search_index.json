In addition to an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA), several machine learning models (Random Forest, SVM, and ANN) were applied to predict the performance of these materials. To enhance predictive accuracy, data engineering techniques were used to impute missing values via a KNN-based approach. Beyond offering a unified and comprehensive dataset, this project enabled the construction of a predictive model with residual errors 50% lower than existing models in the literature.
